Cum-laude degree is generally granted the honor to the top 20, 25% of their class, depending on the institution.</p><p>After working with a New York art dealer after his graduation, he realized that there were hardly any attractive jobs available for the art historians- jobs that would not pay much. Disillusioned, he subsequently enrolled in the London School of Economics in 1985. From here on, he started to focus on making his career in the field of economics and finance, believing this to be a jackpot career of his life. After receiving his MA in Economics, he was hired by a large Wall Street investment bank in New York- Salomon Brothers.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Lewis had been married thrice.
