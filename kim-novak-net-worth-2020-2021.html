Both her parents were original Czech descendants. Joseph, her father, was a history teacher who also took a job as a freight dispatcher at the Chicago Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad. As for her mother, she worked at a factory. Kim attended William Penn Elementary and later went on to join Farragut High School.</p><p>Later on, after her high school life, she went ahead and joined Wright Junior College, where her hard work and talent helped her to bag herself two scholarships at the School of Art Institute of Chicago. During the summer break in her last semester in junior college, Kim went on a cross country tour for a refrigeration company at trade shows.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Kim was first married to English actor Richard Johnson with whom they divorced a year later but still maintained their friendship. She was later engaged to director Richard Quine but never got to do a wedding. She also dated numerous people, including the adopted son of the Dominican Dictator Rafael Trujillo.

It was while she was at Los Angeles where she was discovered by an agent who signed to a contract with Colombia Pictures. At the onset of her career, she was engaged in a battle with Colombia’s chief over the changing of her name to “Kit Marlowe,” but she insisted that her Polish and Czech ancestry were an essential part of her heritage. Therefore, they settled for the name “Kim Novak” instead of as a compromise.</p><p>Kim’s first role was in the film Pushover and the romantic comedy &nbsp;The French Line in 1954.

Later on, her career experienced major setbacks after most of her films proved not to be very successful.</p><p>In 1964 she played a leading role in the movie Kiss Me Stupid, which made no impact on her career. She also was the lead female in the Eye of The Devil alongside David Niven; during the filming of the movie, she fell off a horse and suffered injuries that took time to heal. She later gave up the role.</p><p>By the end of the 60s, she started to act less and decided to focus on visual arts and poetry, and she even moved away from Hollywood. In 1980 she appeared in the British mystery thriller The Mirror Crack’d, which was a moderate success, she did not appear in any other film for the whole of that decade.
